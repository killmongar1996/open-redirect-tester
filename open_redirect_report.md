# Open Redirect Vulnerability Assessment Report

## Target URL
```
<insert tested URL here>

## Methodology

- Used Open Redirect testing tool (CLI/Web version).
- Tested with the following common redirect parameters:
  - redirect, url, next, return, dest, destination, continue, redir, goto
- Payload used: `https://evil.com`
- Manual review of HTTP responses for redirection behavior.

## Summary of Findings

| Parameter   | Test URL                                  | Result      |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------|
| redirect    | <tested_url>?redirect=https://evil.com    | [SAFE/VULNERABLE/ERROR] |
| url         | <tested_url>?url=https://evil.com         | [SAFE/VULNERABLE/ERROR] |
| next        | <tested_url>?next=https://evil.com        | [SAFE/VULNERABLE/ERROR] |
| ...         | ...                                       | ...         |

## Detailed Results

For each tested parameter:
- **Parameter**: `<parameter_name>`
- **Tested URL**: `<url_with_payload>`
- **HTTP Status**: `<status code>`
- **Location Header**: `<Location header if present>`
- **Result**: `[SAFE/VULNERABLE/ERROR]`
- **Notes**: `<any additional notes>`

## Recommendations

- Validate and sanitize all user-supplied input used in redirect URLs.
- Use allow-lists for redirect destinations (only permit known safe URLs).
- Avoid reflecting user-controlled URLs in redirection logic.
- Consider implementing relative redirects only (not absolute URLs).
- Regularly test your application for open redirect vulnerabilities.
